==========

I just want to start things off by showing you how much I enjoy working on these
libraries.  It's July 4th.  I was born and raised in the US.  I have the day off
(as much as an academic can have a day off) and I'm excitedly starting a new
library.

OK.  So my plan for today is to get this lib built and tested such that you can
use it to make comparisons between arbitrary sequences of tokens.  Woo.  I
pulled most of the code from a project that has a more specific goal in mind.
