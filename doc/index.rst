Deltas -- Experimental Difference Algorithms
============================================
**Deltas** is an open licensed (MIT) library for performing generating deltas
(A.K.A sequences of operations) representing the difference between two
sequences of comparable  tokens.

* **Install:** ``pip install deltas``
* **Contribute:** `http://github.com/halfak/Deltas <http://github.com/halfak/Deltas>`_

This library is intended to be used to make experimental difference detection
strategies more easily available.
